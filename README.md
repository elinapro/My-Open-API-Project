# My-Open-API-Project

[Open API project for CTD](https://github.com/elinapro/My-Open-API-Project)

In order to run the site locally, go live using a live view extension.
Starting from launch, the website should display a grid of 9 random dog images. This is the first API fetch.
From there, you can select an image of any of the dogs in order to display a green modal window and a light black overlay covering the main page.

In this modal, you will view the data from the 2nd API fetch. It will display data about the dog such as the breed, life span and temperament, if available. If not, you will only see the image of the dog and a caption of "this is an unknown doggie. breed information is not available." This is due to the API not really being updated entirely with breed info on every single image available.

To close out of the modal, click anywhere outside the modal, or on the X to close it.
You will now be able to clearly view the home page with the grid of 9 dog images.
Now you may select more dogs to learn about, or leave the site.
