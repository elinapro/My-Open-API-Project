# My-Open-API-Project

[Open API project for CTD](https://github.com/elinapro/My-Open-API-Project)

In order to run the site locally, go live using a live view extension.
Starting from launch, the website should display a grid of 9 dog images. This is the first API fetch.
From there, you can select an image of any of the dogs in order to display a modal and a light black overlay. This is the 2nd fetch. It will display data about the dog such as the breed, life span and temperament, if available. If not, you will only see the image of the dog.
To close out of the modal, click anywhere outside the modal, or on the X to close it.
